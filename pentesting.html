        <h1>Pentesting Experience</h1>
        <p>
          When it comes to testing the security flaws of a system, we might
          often think about a singular element, like a website or application
          that we would attempt to breach. The reality behind penetration
          testing is that there is a standard to follow. This protocol/standard
          outlines and details the following sections;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Reconnaisance</li>
          <li>Scanning</li>
          <li>Vulnerability Assessment</li>
          <li>Exploitation</li>
          <li>Post Exploit Reporting</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Each phase allows a penetration tester to gather and collect valuable
          insight and information throughout, which is then fed directly into
          the exploitation and reporting phases. There are also tools that are
          made specifically for each phase that allow hackers to navigate
          themselves correctly during the overall procedure.<br /><br />
          An unspoken requirement that's not often mentioned is using Kali Linux
          or Linux for penetration testing, because of the flexibility you have
          and access to a large ecosystem of purpose-built tools. There are
          trade secrets in every field of profession, and whilst I give you what
          I know here to showcase my skills, I would like to add that for each
          phase, there are many other resources that can be used throughout.

                  The Network Mapper tool was designed by Gordon Lyon and helps
                  penetration testers like us identify flaws within a network.
                  It not only reveals information on the network itself but can
                  also provide information like open ports or service
                  information that can then help security analysts identify
                  where they would need to implement enhanced security measures.
                  <br /><br />

                  The command format or style on nmap looks like the following:
                  nmap [IP Address] [ports] [switches]. An example could be nmap
                  111.111.111 -p- -sV, which would reveal the service
                  information for the ports specified. Of course, the more you
                  use this tool, the more methods you learn for using different
                  commands to perform different tasks.
                  <br /><br />

                  Overall, this tool provides insight into a network and its
                  devices, which is used to strengthen a system. It’s primarily
                  used within the reconnaissance and scanning phases, which help
                  pentesters understand what entry points there could be into a
                  network and system.

                <p><strong>John The Ripper</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  John the Ripper is a password-cracking tool that attempts to
                  recover passwords by systematically trying entries from a
                  dictionary or precompiled list. This method is particularly
                  effective against weak or commonly used passwords. The tool
                  often leverages large password databases, including publicly
                  available lists, to guide its attempts.<br /><br />

                  Using John the Ripper highlights the importance of strong
                  password policies and secure storage practices. Modern tools
                  like rainbow tables store encrypted versions of passwords
                  alongside their plaintext equivalents, allowing testers to
                  quickly determine if a password can be derived from its hash.
                  This demonstrates how easily weak credentials can be
                  compromised if proper safeguards are not in place.<br /><br />

                  In penetration testing, John the Ripper is primarily employed
                  during the vulnerability assessment phase. It allows testers
                  to evaluate the strength of passwords in use, identify weak or
                  reused credentials, and provide actionable recommendations to
                  improve authentication security, such as enforcing complexity
                  requirements or implementing multi-factor authentication.

              <div>
                <p>
                  Similar to John the Ripper, this tool utilizes a dictionary of
                  file types and names to identify hidden directories within a
                  server or application. By leveraging this approach, it is
                  possible to locate sensitive, valuable, or misconfigured files
                  that may require further investigation.<br /><br />

                  Directory busters work by sending a large volume of HTTP
                  requests to uncover potential paths. For example, files or
                  directories may be hidden from search engines using a
                  robots.txt file, which instructs crawlers not to index certain
                  paths. However, the presence of such files is not
                  eliminated—they can still be discovered if the filename is
                  known. This tool enables the identification of hidden
                  directories or files so that appropriate measures, such as
                  access restriction or improved security controls, can be
                  applied.<br /><br />

                  Typically, security teams incorporate this tool into routine
                  scanning or vulnerability assessments to proactively identify
                  and remediate potential risks.

                <p><strong>Website Fuzzer</strong></p>

                <p>
                  Website fuzzers operate the same functions as Directory
                  Busters, but are performed on a website or application. These
                  allow you to find any anomalies that could suggest hidden
                  parameters, functionality, or improper input handling.<br /><br />

                  A better explanation of this would be to think of having
                  implemented a form on your website, which is usually secure.
                  With the correct inputs, it could bring back results that
                  contain information regarding the backend of your server,
                  which then would pose a security flaw, as a hacker could now
                  sit and potentially find various ways of entry into your
                  system.<br /><br />

                  You’ll usually use this tool during the vulnerability
                  assessments and scanning phases, as this is all to do with
                  collecting information and resources. This also highlights a
                  topic renowned as injection attacks.

                <p>
                  Injection attacks are intrusive in the sense that they are
                  done with almost no visibility into the backend of a system,
                  but are used to provide detailed information about it. In my
                  experience of using tools like SQLmap, you are able to build
                  queries that are processed as usual but have malicious
                  intent.<br /><br />

                  SQLmap, in particular, looks to perform injection attacks on
                  databases that are associated with your website or
                  application. It can help someone identify what types of input
                  sanitisation methods would be needed to prevent attacks like
                  this from happening.<br /><br />

                  This type of tool is used during the vulnerability assessment
                  and exploit phases, as it is used to not only perform the
                  attacks to get into a system by retrieving sensitive
                  information, but also allow entry into a system through
                  errors.

                  Burp Suite is an application that allows for intercepting,
                  analysing, and manipulating web requests in real-time. Think
                  of loading your browser and searching for a website on Google,
                  which then brings you back results. This is handled as a
                  request that is sent with much information included their like
                  a get, put, post, or delete request. <br /><br />

                  I’m sure that the list of requests above can ignite a
                  brainstorm of how requests can be handled by the web. Now,
                  what if we were able to stop a request midway through, modify
                  the request type and then have that sent to the server? Almost
                  like being in the middle of a connection between two users.<br /><br />

                  The options available within this tool make it a valuable
                  resource to use during scanning and vulnerability assessment
                  phases.

                  Wireshark is used to analyze packet captures, validate
                  protocol behavior, investigate potential data exfiltration
                  paths, and gather authoritative network-level evidence.
                  Through detailed inspection and annotation of relevant traffic
                  flows, it supports technical findings and informs remediation
                  guidance.<br /><br />

                  Conceptually, Wireshark decodes captured packets to reveal
                  protocol exchanges across multiple network layers. Common
                  analysis tasks include isolating conversations between hosts,
                  identifying plaintext credential exposure, and verifying the
                  presence and integrity of encrypted channels. Typical outputs
                  consist of filtered capture segments, annotated protocol
                  streams, and timeline visualizations that corroborate
                  higher-level assessment results.<br /><br />

                  This technique is most often applied during reconnaissance or
                  vulnerability assessment phases. The rationale is that packet
                  analysis provides low-level confirmation of network behaviors
                  and helps validate or contextualize vulnerabilities identified
                  at the application or infrastructure level. Portfolio examples
                  might describe neutral cases such as extracting and annotating
                  protocol streams to demonstrate configuration weaknesses
                  within technical appendices.
