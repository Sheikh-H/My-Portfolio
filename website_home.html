        <p>
          Building websites is relatively easy online, we have access to
          platforms like WIX that allows us to build websites in a few clicks -
          The problem is mallaebility.<br />
          Businesses and individuals all know the ease of making and maintaining
          a website with modern day online applications. But, you still want and
          need the website to function in an exact manner for your business and
          to represent your business. That's done through tailoring your
          website.

              This website was created during my time at Code Nation as part of
              a design project. While not my best work, I chose to showcase it
              as it highlights how far my design skills have come since then. It
              also wasn’t my first web project, as I had previously developed
              complete systems during my university studies.<br /><br />
              The objective was to create a business concept and design a static
              website to represent it. The site needed to present the company to
              an online audience and include a marketing plan. We were given
              roughly a week to complete the project, so efficiency and clear
              design choices were key.<br /><br />
              The final product turned out quite elegant and demonstrated my
              growing confidence in layout design. Through this build, I learned
              to use the CSS ‘Grid’ property, which enables repeating sections
              within a layout and ensures a consistent, well-aligned appearance
              across the website.

              This project was created in my spare time as part of exploring how
              technology can solve real business challenges. I often look at
              local businesses to identify areas for digital improvement, which
              helps me stay sharp at spotting opportunities and understanding
              technology’s impact on operations.<br /><br />
              The goal was to design a modern version of a takeaway website
              inspired by platforms like Uber Eats and Just Eat. I wanted to
              enhance the overall look and feel while improving user experience
              and convenience—key factors for any business operating in today’s
              fast-paced, service-driven world.<br /><br />
              The outcome was a functional website where users can log in, place
              orders, print receipts, and save their details, combining
              practical features with a clean, user-focused design.
